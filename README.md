The e-Book App "Librare".
Built with React Native.
I used Google Firebase, Google Books API and axios.
Also used Open AI Dall-E2 to create unique background images on Forgot Password screen and Sign Up screen.
To make a stable and optimizated app, I used OpenAI's chatgpt to review the code and find possible better solutions.
I used Google Fonts' Playfair Display font.
