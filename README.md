The e-Book App "Librare".
Built with React Native.
Used Google Firebase, Google Books API and axios.
Also used Open AI Dall-E2 to create unique background images on Forgot Password screen and Sign Up screen.
To make a stable and optimizated app, I also used OpenAI's chatgpt to review the code and find possible better solutions.
I also used Google Fonts' Playfair Display font.
